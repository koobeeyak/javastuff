Course Search
=============
- Queries.java will query several course databases to display course detail options to the user.
- The user will select semester of interest and may further narrow down courses by criteria such as discipline, undergraduate/graduate level, day of the week, professor name (case insensitive implementation).
- A query is built based on each step of the user's course search request.
- Relevant courses are displayed to the user. If a course is selected, it's details are queried from a separate database and displayed from the user (prerequisites, details, etc.).
